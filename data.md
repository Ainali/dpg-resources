# Open Data

The [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/) discusses the legal, social and technical aspects of open data. It can be used by anyone but is especially designed for those seeking to open up data. It discusses the why, what and how of open data – why to go open, what open is, and the how to &#39;open&#39; data.

[Publishing Open Government Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/gov-data/) Is designed to help governments open and share their data, the W3C eGov Interest Group has developed the following guidelines. These straightforward steps emphasize standards and methodologies to encourage publication of government data, allowing the public to use this data in new and innovative ways.

[The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative](https://dublincore.org/) supports innovation in metadata design and best practices. DCMI is supported by its members and is a project of ASIS&T.


## Data Protection Impact Assessment

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a way for you to systematically and comprehensively analyse your processing and help you identify and minimise data protection risks. DPIAs should consider compliance risks, but also broader risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals, including the potential for any significant social or economic disadvantage. The focus is on the potential for harm – to individuals or to society at large, whether it is physical, material or non-material. To assess the level of risk, a DPIA must consider both the likelihood and the severity of any impact on individuals.

Data protection impact assessments are required under GDPR but in general are a good idea to require for any humanitarian technology project using data. Most EU countries will have a web page with resources on how to conduct one. For reference, refer to [the one from the UK](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments/) which includes a document template that you just fill out.
