# Open Data

The [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/)discusses the legal, social and technical aspects of open data. It can be used by anyone but is especially designed for those seeking to open up data. It discusses the why, what and how of open data â€“ why to go open, what open is, and the how to &#39;open&#39; data.

[Publishing Open Government Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/gov-data/) To help governments open and share their data, the W3C eGov Interest Group has developed the following guidelines. These straightforward steps emphasize standards and methodologies to encourage publication of government data, allowing the public to use this data in new and innovative ways.
