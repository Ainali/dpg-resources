# DPG Recommended licenses

The first draft of DPG recommended licenses contain a collection of 5 licenses. These licenses cover different user scenarios and represent the most used copy-left and permissive licenses.

GPL [3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) The GNU&#39;s General Public License, or GPL, is one of the foundation open source licenses. Created by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). It is the preferred license for projects authorized by the FSF.

[Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) – easiest for incorporating into proprietary software, as compliance requirements are minimal.

[MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) - The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.

[LGPL 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html) – Share-and-share-alike terms, for a restricted file set, allows combination with proprietary software.

[Affero GPL 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) – Familiar GPL share-and-share-alike for the entire program, with a provision regarding software-as-a-service.
