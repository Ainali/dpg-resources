# Contributing to DPG Resources

Thanks for checking out the DPG Resources! We're excited to hear and learn from you. Your experiences will benefit others who read and use these resources.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.

## Types of contributions we're looking for

There are many ways you can directly contribute to the guides (in descending order of need):

- Fix editorial inconsistencies or inaccuracies
- Add new content, templates or resources
- Improve existing documentation or structure

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source and digital public goods should be done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* DPG Respurces are released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created, as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/dpg-resources/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/dpg-resources/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, open a pull request.
