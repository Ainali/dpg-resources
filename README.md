# Resources for DPG Nominees

The goal of this resource collection is to help DPGs, both who are successful or not successful with their submission, continue to approve their project within the focus areas of the DPG indicators. Theis readme file will contain the acumulated resourses, while the subfiles will be documents under development. 


## Open Source resources

- [The Apache Project Maturity Model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html) - A suggested framework for evaluating the overall maturity of an Apache project community and the codebase that it maintains. While this model is specific to Apache projects many of these factors are important for any open source project.
- The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) are a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project.(specific for and by Github, but many parts can be re-mixed and re-used for more general purpose)
- [The Standard for Public Code](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/blob/develop/introduction.md) is a set of criteria that supports public organizations in developing and maintaining software and policy together. The Standard describes a number of criteria. All criteria have consistent sections that make it clear how to create great public code. Below is a brief explanation of each of these sections and how they are used within the criteria of the Standard.
- [The Linux Foundation Open Source Guides For The Enterprise](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/resources/open-source-guides/). Leverage best practices for running an open source program office or starting an open source project in your organization. Developed by The Linux Foundation in partnership with the TODO Group, these resources represent the experience of our staff, projects, and members.
- [A primer developed by the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative](https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/reports/building-and-reusing-open-source-tools-government/) for any government entity thinking about embracing open source solutions. Open source tools have been around since the 1980s, and used by governments for decades. As a result, there are known methods for making the most of using the resource.
- [A manual from Gov.uk - Making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable) When you create new source code, you must make it open so that other developers (including those outside government) can benefit from your work and build on it, learn from your experiences and find uses for your code which you hadnâ€™t found.

## Content

There are many different categories of content and contexts for using content types. [sub-categories of content will be added]

### General resources for Creative Commons licenses
- [The Creative Commons Legal Database](https://creativecommons.org/2020/12/03/explore-the-new-cc-legal-database-site/) is a collection of case law and legal scholarship to help our users learn more about legal issues surrounding Creative Commons (CC) licenses and legal tools. This information has been contributed by many dedicated members of the CC Global Network and the CC Legal Team. 

- [The Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) give everyone from individual creators to large institutions a standardized way to grant the public permission to use their creative work under copyright law. This page provides basic inforamtion and guidlines for picking licenses based on spesific user or project goals. 

### Open educational resources

- [The Open Education Handbook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Handbook). &quot;Open Education&quot; is a topic which has become increasingly popular in a variety of contexts. This handbook has been written to provide a useful point of reference for readers with a range of different roles and interests who are interested in learning more about the concept of Open Education and to help them deal with a variety of practical situations.

- [Guidelines for open educational resources (OER) in higher education](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/guidelines-for-open-educational-resources-oer-in-higher-education/). These Guidelines outline key issues and make suggestions for integrating OER into higher education. Their purpose is to encourage decision makers in governments and institutions to invest in the systematic production, adaptation and use of OER and to bring them into the mainstream of higher education in order to improve the quality of curricula and teaching and to reduce costs.

## Compliance and best practice 

### Security
[The OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org/) works to improve the security of software through its community-led open source software projects, hundreds of chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and by hosting local and global conferences.




### Accessibility guidelines

The [WCAG 2.0 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible. GDL will follow these guidelines to secure that the content is accessible for all users. By following these guidelines one will also often make the web content more usable in general.

Common accessibility guidelines specific for EPUB in addition to WCAG: (e.g. [EPUB 3 Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility.html)).

[10 Tips for Creating Accessible EPUB 3](https://blog.bookshare.org/2013/03/10-tips-for-creating-accessible-epub-3-files/). The DIAGRAM Center, WGBH National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM), and the U.S. Fund for DAISY are collaborating to identify challenges within the technologies, standards and production practices used to produce and display accessible images and graphic content within AIM, and develop technologies, tools, recommended practices and training materials that address them. In support of this goal, the DIAGRAM Center has produced this document with 10 tips for creating accessible EPUB 3 files.

## Best Practices and Principles
