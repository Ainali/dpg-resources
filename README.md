# DPG Resources

A single place for all documentation, recources, guides and templates to help digital solutions with their Digital Public Good (DPG) application and for successful DPGs to continue to improve their project within the focus areas of the [DPG Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/).

> If you are not yet a recognized digital public good, consider applying! Learn more about it [here](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/) and review the [eligibility requirements](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission-guide/).

## 🙋 Getting started

Welcome, please select the starting point for your journey:

1. [I have a project that I want to make open source](#open-sourcing-your-project)
2. [I have an open source solution, how can I make it a DPG?](#becoming-a-digital-public-good)
3. [My project is a DPG, how can I improve it?](#improving-your-project)

## 🔓 Open Sourcing your Project
You can refer to the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) for an  in-depth approach on how to start an open source project.

You can also check our [Open Source resources](docs/opensource.md). Some _musts_ for an open source project are:

- Source: a public repository or platform where you can host your source code, data or content.
- Docs: some basic documentation for the community to be able to understand, access or contribute to you project.
- People: make sure you've talked to your legal department and your developer team.

## 🌍 Becoming a Digital Public Good

In order to successfully become an accredited DPG you must adhere to the [DPG Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) and [submit an application](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/) for review to the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA).

### Quick Start

Use our [DPG Eligibility Tool](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/eligibility/) to quickly determine if your digital solution can be nominated as a DPG.
Once you know if your solution is elegible, read the [Submission Guide](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission-guide/) for more information about the DPG application process.
