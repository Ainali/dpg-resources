# Open Source resources

- [The Apache Project Maturity Model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html) - A suggested framework for evaluating the overall maturity of an Apache project community and the codebase that it maintains. While this model is specific to Apache projects many of these factors are important for any open source project.
- The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) are a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project.(specific for and by Github, but many parts can be re-mixed and re-used for more general purpose)
- [The Standard for Public Code](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/blob/develop/introduction.md) is a set of criteria that supports public organizations in developing and maintaining software and policy together. The Standard describes a number of criteria. All criteria have consistent sections that make it clear how to create great public code. Below is a brief explanation of each of these sections and how they are used within the criteria of the Standard.
- [The Linux Foundation Open Source Guides For The Enterprise](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/resources/open-source-guides/). Leverage best practices for running an open source program office or starting an open source project in your organization. Developed by The Linux Foundation in partnership with the TODO Group, these resources represent the experience of our staff, projects, and members.
- [A primer developed by the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative](https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/reports/building-and-reusing-open-source-tools-government/) for any government entity thinking about embracing open source solutions. Open source tools have been around since the 1980s, and used by governments for decades. As a result, there are known methods for making the most of using the resource.
- [A manual from Gov.uk - Making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable) When you create new source code, you must make it open so that other developers (including those outside government) can benefit from your work and build on it, learn from your experiences and find uses for your code which you hadnâ€™t found.
