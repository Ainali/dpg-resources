## Accessibility guidelines

The [WCAG 2.0 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible. GDL will follow these guidelines to secure that the content is accessible for all users. By following these guidelines one will also often make the web content more usable in general.

Common accessibility guidelines specific for EPUB in addition to WCAG: (e.g. [EPUB 3 Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility.html)).

[10 Tips for Creating Accessible EPUB 3](https://blog.bookshare.org/2013/03/10-tips-for-creating-accessible-epub-3-files/). The DIAGRAM Center, WGBH National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM), and the U.S. Fund for DAISY are collaborating to identify challenges within the technologies, standards and production practices used to produce and display accessible images and graphic content within AIM, and develop technologies, tools, recommended practices and training materials that address them. In support of this goal, the DIAGRAM Center has produced this document with 10 tips for creating accessible EPUB 3 files.
